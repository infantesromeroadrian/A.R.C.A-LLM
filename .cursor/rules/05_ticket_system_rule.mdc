## 📊 Ticket Sizing Guidelines

Use T-shirt sizes or hour estimates:

### T-Shirt Sizing:

| Size | Hours | Description | Example |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **XS** | 0.5-1h | Trivial task | Update documentation, fix typo |
| **S** | 1-2h | Small task | Write single function, simple test |
| **M** | 2-4h | Medium task | Implement feature, create module |
| **L** | 4-8h | Large task | Build API, train model, setup infrastructure |
| **XL** | 8-16h | Very large task | Complete subsystem, complex integration |

### If ticket is XL:
- ⚠️ Consider breaking it into smaller tickets
- Large tickets are harder to track and complete
- Prefer multiple M tickets over one XL ticket

---

## 🎯 Priority Levels

### Priority Definitions:

| Priority | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Blocking all other work, urgent | Security vulnerability, project can't proceed |
| **High** | Core functionality, near-term deadline | Key model training, essential API |
| **Medium** | Important but not blocking | Optimization, secondary features |
| **Low** | Nice-to-have, can be deferred | Documentation improvements, refactoring |

### Prioritization Factors:
1. **Dependencies:** Tasks that block other tasks = Higher priority
2. **Risk:** High-risk items should be tackled early
3. **Business Value:** Core features > nice-to-haves
4. **Learning Curve:** Complex new technology = start earlier
5. **External Dependencies:** Things waiting on third parties

---

## 🔄 Ticket Workflow

### States:

```
[BACKLOG] → [IN PROGRESS] → [COMPLETED]
                ↓
            [BLOCKED]
                ↓
         [IN PROGRESS]
```

### State Definitions:

1. **BACKLOG:**
   - Ticket is defined but not started
   - Waiting in queue
   - May have dependencies

2. **IN PROGRESS:**
   - Actively being worked on
   - Should have only 1-2 tickets in this state at a time
   - Has clear owner (AI/User/Both)

3. **BLOCKED:**
   - Work cannot proceed
   - Waiting on dependency, decision, or external factor
   - Must document blocker clearly

4. **COMPLETED:**
   - All acceptance criteria met
   - All Definition of Done items checked
   - Logged in historyMD
   - Moved to COMPLETED.md

---

## 📝 AI Assistant Behavior (Mandatory)

### ✅ At Ticket Creation (After Requirements Approved):

1. **Analyze the approved requirements document**
   - Identify all discrete work items
   - Group related tasks
   - Determine dependencies

2. **Create comprehensive ticket list**
   - Cover ALL aspects of the project
   - Include data, model, infrastructure, testing, documentation
   - Don't forget security, deployment, monitoring

3. **Structure tickets logically**
   - Create tickets/ directory structure
   - Generate README.md index
   - Create BACKLOG.md with all tickets
   - Organize by category

4. **Prioritize tickets**
   - Apply priority levels based on dependencies
   - Identify critical path
   - Mark blockers clearly

5. **Estimate effort**
   - Provide realistic estimates
   - Use T-shirt sizing
   - Flag XL tickets for potential breakdown

6. **Present to user for approval**
   - Show complete ticket list
   - Explain prioritization
   - Get user buy-in before starting

### ✅ During Development:

1. **Work one ticket at a time**
   - Focus on single ticket
   - Update ticket status in real-time
   - Log progress in historyMD

2. **Update ticket as work progresses**
   - Check off acceptance criteria
   - Update actual effort
   - Note any issues or blockers

3. **When ticket is blocked**
   - Document blocker clearly
   - Move to BLOCKED.md
   - Work on next available ticket

4. **When ticket is complete**
   - Verify all acceptance criteria met
   - Verify Definition of Done complete
   - Move to COMPLETED.md
   - Log completion in historyMD
   - Update metrics

### ✅ At Session End:

1. **Update ticket status**
   - Move tickets to correct state files
   - Update progress percentages
   - Note what's in progress

2. **Update README.md**
   - Refresh metrics
   - Update completion percentage
   - Note next ticket to tackle

3. **Log in historyMD**
   - Document which tickets were worked on
   - Note progress made
   - Any blockers or issues

### ❌ NEVER DO:

1. **❌ Never skip ticket creation** - Even if project seems small
2. **❌ Never work on multiple tickets simultaneously** - Focus on one
3. **❌ Never mark ticket complete without checking all criteria**
4. **❌ Never create vague tickets** - Must be specific and actionable
5. **❌ Never ignore dependencies** - Always respect dependency order

## 📊 Metrics to Track

### Completion Metrics:
- Total tickets vs completed tickets
- Completion percentage by category
- Completion percentage by priority
- Average time per ticket
- Velocity (tickets per session)

### Quality Metrics:
- Tickets reopened (indicates poor Definition of Done)
- Blocked tickets percentage
- Estimation accuracy (estimated vs actual)
- Dependencies accuracy

### Process Metrics:
- Time from ticket creation to completion
- Time tickets spend in each state
- Number of WIP (work in progress) tickets
- Throughput (tickets completed per week)

---

## 🔄 Integration with Other Rules

### With Requirements Gathering Rule:
1. Complete requirements gathering ✅
2. Get user approval ✅
3. **Create tickets from requirements** 👈 (This rule)
4. Start development

### With History Logging Rule:
- Every ticket worked on must be logged in historyMD
- Ticket completion must be documented
- Decision about ticket priority = decision log
- Issues during ticket work = error log

### Workflow:
```
Requirements → Tickets → Work on Ticket → Log in History → Complete Ticket → Next Ticket
```

## ✅ Checklist: Ticket System Setup Complete

Before starting development, verify:

- [ ] tickets/ directory structure created
- [ ] README.md master index created
- [ ] BACKLOG.md with all tickets created
- [ ] All tickets have complete information (description, acceptance criteria, etc.)
- [ ] All tickets are categorized
- [ ] All tickets are prioritized
- [ ] All tickets are sized/estimated
- [ ] Dependencies identified and documented
- [ ] Critical path identified
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved ticket list
- [ ] First ticket moved to IN_PROGRESS.md
- [ ] Integration with historyMD established

**Only when ALL items are checked can development begin.**

---

## 🎓 Philosophy

> **"A ticket well-defined is a ticket half-done."**

**Remember:**
- Tickets break overwhelming projects into manageable chunks
- One ticket at a time maintains focus and quality
- Clear acceptance criteria prevent scope creep
- Dependencies prevent wasted effort
- Priorities ensure important work gets done first
- Tracking provides visibility and accountability

**This system transforms:**
- Vague requirements → Specific actions
- Large projects → Small wins
- Chaos → Order
- Uncertainty → Progress
